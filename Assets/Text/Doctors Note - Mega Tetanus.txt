SUBJECT: Mega Tetanus

Hey Systems Manager, 

Just wanted to give you a little update on the whole "zombie outbreak in the bunker" thing. 

As I'm sure you've seen from your office, a couple of the residents recently turned into flesh eating, violent psychopaths.

Upon observation of the "condition", we've managed to discover two key things.

Number one: It is curable, with a mix of antibiotics, and uranium-235. 

Number two: The disease itself is a form of tetanus, or mega-tetanus, which seems to come from nails and other metal tools in the shelter that have been unknowingly contaminated.


As long as any potential cases are treated ASAP, we should be safe from any other outbreaks.
