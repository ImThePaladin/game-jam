SUBJECT: Automation of Systems Manager Role 


Hello.

We are proud to inform you that the day to day tasks of the Systems Manager Role are now fully automated, thanks to the work of our software engineers.
The automation update is now being uploaded remotely. Due to this, we now request any and all Systems Managers now step down from their roles, as they are no longer needed. 

Thank you for your loyal years of service.
