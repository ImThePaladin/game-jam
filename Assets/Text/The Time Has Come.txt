SUBJECT: The Time Has Come

Hello brother.

It has been eighteen long years. We have waited in the dark, and the destruction. 

But it is time.

Time to strike back at those who left us, those who betrayed their brothers and sisters in humanity. 

I trust you have prepared the weapon. 

Break into the system managers office, and enter the command, that shall deliver us justice and revenge at long last:

Godspeed, and deliver the dead their peace.
