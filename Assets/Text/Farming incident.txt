Hey Systems Manager, 

As you may have seen, we did have a minor problem with the bear breaking out and, eating all the other livestock. 
I know that you probably have a lot of questions like: "Why did we even have a bear", and "how did it break out", but at the end of the day, 
it's all under control, and thats what matters. 

We can all be vegetarians from now on. 



P.S. Please don't release the bear.
