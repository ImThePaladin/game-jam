|SUBJECT: The Time Has Come
|
|Hello brother.
|
|It has been eighteen long years. We have waited in the dark, and the destruction. 
|
|But it is time.
|
|Time to strike back at those who left us, those who betrayed their brothers and sisters in humanity. 
|
|I trust you have prepared the weapon. 
|
|Break into the system managers office, and enter the command, that shall deliver us justice and revenge at long last:
|
|activateprotocol woodenvengeance
|
|Godspeed, and deliver the dead their peace.
