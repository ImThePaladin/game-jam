SUBJECT: Possible Threat

Hello. 

We have recently identified a new organisation on the surface which could present a threat to the shelters. 
While we have not been able to identify much information, we are sure this organisation intends to, at some point, attack shelters accross the world.
Any attempt to communicate or negotiate with this faction is strictly forbidden. 

Stay vigilant, and stay loyal.
