Hello! And welcome, to the:

**Systems Manager Role!**

Previous to the apocalype you were scouted, and recruited by *#~!*#@ for the position of System Manager. 
Now that you've made your home in the underground shelter, we thought we'd give you a bit of context about your role for the forseeable future. 



As the Systems Manager, you are the nerve center of the shelter. With your trusty command terminal, you will assist the rest of the residents in their daily tasks.

At, least, thats what we say to them!
